This is the supporting package for the projects in the papers listed below.

Please feel free to reach out with errors, critiques, or questions.

## Installation

Before proceeding, ensure you have R installed. You will also need the devtools package, which can be installed with:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

Additionally, please check that you have R version 4.5. STRINGdb and RCy3 will also need to be installed before moving forward.

To install STRINGdb, use the following code (gathered from https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/STRINGdb.html):

```
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("STRINGdb")
```

To install RCy3, use the following code (gathered from https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RCy3.html):

```
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("RCy3")
```

Once these are installed, you can install this package directly from GitHub using:

```
devtools::install_github("UM-Applied-Algorithms-Lab/PTMsToPathways")
```

## Usage

After installation, load the package in R with:

```
library(PTMsToPathways)
```

You can then use the available functions as described in the package documentation.

## Development & Contribution

Todo: either move all instruction to [the wiki](https://github.com/UM-Applied-Algorithms-Lab/PTMsToPathways/wiki) and keep the link here, or give a brief summary below and say there are more details in the wiki (and still link to it).

If you wish to modify or contribute to the package, clone the repository locally using:

```
git clone https://github.com/UM-Applied-Algorithms-Lab/PTMsToPathways.git
```

Then, in R, navigate to the package directory. You will need to use devtools to load the package for development, so ensure you have that installed and libraried:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

You may then load the package for development:

```
load_all()
```

To check for issues before committing changes, run:

```
check()
```
