# Helper function for Rtsne since parameters are set
#
# This function is made to help people new to the Rtsne function understand parameters and organize code. All it does is call Rtsne with set parameters. If you understand R code, feel free to modify the parameters and resource the function.
#
# @param table The matrix that Rtsne needs to be performed on. It's called table because a lot of operations contain the word "matrix" so it was called something else to not be confusing.
# @param iter Number of iterations, defaults 5000
#
# @return A matrix where each row has 3 dimensionial t-SNE coords for a given matrix.

  # Parameters: dims = 3 (3D output), perplexity = 15, theta = 0.25 (speed/accuracy trade-off) #

#' Build Clusters Based on PTM Data Under Like Conditions
#'
#' This function takes the post-translational modification table and runs it through three calculations of distance:
#' Euclidean Distance, Spearman Dissimilarity (1 - |Spearman Correlation|), and the average of the two of these.
#' These calculations find the 'distance' between ptms based upon under what conditions they occur.
#' These matricies are then run through t-SNE in order to put them into a 3-dimensional space. Additionally, the intersection of these 3 clusters is also created.
#' A correlation table is also produced based on the Spearman Correlation table.
#'
#' Please note: t-SNE involves an element of randomness; in order to get the same results, set.seed(#) must be called.
#'
#' @param ptmtable A dataset for post-translational modifications. Formatted with row's names containing PTM names. The column names should be drugs. Values are numeric values that represent how much the PTM has reacted to the drug.
#' @param keeplength Only keep clusters of ptms whose size is larger than this parameter. (I.e keeplength = 2 then keep ("AARS", "ARMS", "AGRS") but not ("AARS", "ARMS")); default is 2
#' @param toolong A numeric threshold for cluster separation, defaults to 3.5.
#' @return A list with these data structures at the given index: \cr
#' \strong{1} (Consensus Clusters as a list): Clusters in all 3 distance metrices as a list.\cr
#' \strong{2} (Consensus Clusters as an adjacent matrix) A matrix containing values of 0s and 1s depending on if the PTMs are cocluster with other PTMs, rows and columns are unamed. \cr
#' \strong{3} (PTM Correlation Matrix) A data frame showing the correlation between ptms (as the rows and the columns) with NAs placed along the diagonal.
