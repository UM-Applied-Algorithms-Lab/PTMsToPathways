#' Filter PPI Network by Known Clusters
#'
#' All edges in the PPI network are checked against the cocluster correlation network to ensure existence and a non-zero weight.
#' If either of these conditions are not met, then it will be removed from the list of PPI edges.
#' This new, cluster filtered network is then assigned to the global namespace.
#'
#' @param gene.cccn A matrix showing strength of relationships between proteins using the common clusters between the three distance metrics (Euclidean, Spearman, and Combined (SED))
#' @param ppi.network A dataframe representing how strongly proteins are known to interact based on previous research contained within provided database networks
#' @param cfn.name Desired name of the output cluster filtered network
#'
#' @return A version of ppi.network with only the edges that exist in gene.cccn and have non-zero weights
