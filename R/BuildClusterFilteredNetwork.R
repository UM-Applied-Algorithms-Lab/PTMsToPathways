#' Build PPI Network
#'
#' Uses all inputted database information on protein-protein interactions in order to create a combined PPI-network.
#'
#' @param stringdb.edges Data frame of consisting of the network of interactions from the genes of study pulled from the STRINGdb database
#' @param genemania.edges GeneMANIA network of protein-protein interactions from the genes of study; defaults to NA
#' @param db.filepaths A vector of paths to the additional ppi network files; defaults to an empty vector
#' @param ppi.network.name Desired name for the output protein-protein interaction network using all entered database input; defaults to ppi.network
#'
#' @return A dataframe representing how strongly proteins are known to interact based on previous research contained within provided database networks
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' ex.string <- ex.stringdb.edges
#' ex.gm <- ex.genemania.edges
#' #' Filter PPI Network by Known Clusters
#'
#' All edges in the PPI network are checked against the cocluster correlation network to ensure existence and a non-zero weight.
#' If either of these conditions are not met, then it will be removed from the list of PPI edges.
#' This new, cluster filtered network is then assigned to the global namespace.
#'
#' @param gene.cccn A matrix showing strength of relationships between proteins using the common clusters between the three distance metrics (Euclidean, Spearman, and Combined (SED))
#' @param ppi.network A dataframe representing how strongly proteins are known to interact based on previous research contained within provided database networks
#' @param cfn.name Desired name of the output cluster filtered network
#'
#' @return A version of ppi.network with only the edges that exist in gene.cccn and have non-zero weights
#'
#' @export
#' @examples
#' ClusterFilteredNetwork(ex.gene.cccn, ex.ppi.network, cfn.name = "ex.cfn")
#' utils::head(ex.cfn)
