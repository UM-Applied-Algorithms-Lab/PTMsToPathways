#' Pathway Crosstalk Network
#'
#' Converts Bioplanet pathways from (<https://tripod.nih.gov/bioplanet/>)  into a list of pathways whose elements are the genes in each pathway. Edge weights are either the PTM Cluster Weight or according to the Jaccard Similarity.
#'
#' @param common.clusters The list of common clusters between all three distance metrics (Euclidean, Spearman, and SED). Can be made in MakeCorrelationNetwork
#' @param bioplanet.file Either the name of the bioplanet pathway .csv file OR a dataframe. Lines of bioplanet should possess 4 values in the order "PATHWAY_ID","PATHWAY_NAME","GENE_ID","GENE_SYMBOL". Users not well versed in R should only pass in "yourfilename.csv"
#' @param edgelist.name The desired name of the Pathway to Pathway edgelist file created ('.csv' will automatically be added to the end for you); defaults to edgelist. Intended for use in Cytoscape.
#' @param createfile The path of where to create the edgelist file. Defaults to the working directory, if FALSE is provided, a file will not be created.
#' @return An edgelist file that is created in the working directory. Contains pathway source-target columns, with edge weights of their jaccard similarity and their Pathway-Pathway Evidence score
#' @export

To see if two pathways have relation to the same cluster, I want to see if they have nonzero values in the same cluster (row).
