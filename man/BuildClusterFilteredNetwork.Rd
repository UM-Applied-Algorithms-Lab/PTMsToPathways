\title{#' Filter PPI Network by Known Clusters}
\usage{
BuildClusterFilteredNetwork(
  stringdb.edges,
  genemania.edges,
  gene.cccn.edges,
  db.filepaths = c(),
  ppi.network.name = "combined.PPIs",
  cfn.name = "cfn",
  returndata = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cfn.name}{Desired name of the output cluster filtered network}

\item{gene.cccn}{A matrix showing strength of relationships between proteins using the common clusters between the three distance metrics (Euclidean, Spearman, and Combined (SED))}

\item{ppi.network}{A dataframe representing how strongly proteins are known to interact based on previous research contained within provided database networks}
}
\value{
A version of ppi.network with only the edges that exist in gene.cccn and have non-zero weights
}
\description{
All edges in the PPI network are checked against the cocluster correlation network to ensure existence and a non-zero weight.
If either of these conditions are not met, then it will be removed from the list of PPI edges.
This new, cluster filtered network is then assigned to the global namespace.
}
\examples{
ClusterFilteredNetwork(ex.gene.cccn, ex.ppi.network, cfn.name = "ex.cfn")
utils::head(ex.cfn)
