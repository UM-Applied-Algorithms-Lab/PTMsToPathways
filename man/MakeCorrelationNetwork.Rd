\title{Make Correlation Network}
\usage{
MakeCorrelationNetwork(adj.consensus, ptm.correlation.matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj.consensus}{Adjacency matrix showing PTM co-cluster relationships from all three t-SNE embeddings}

\item{ptm.correlation.matrix}{A data frame showing the correlation between ptms (as the rows and the columns). NAs are placed along the diagonal.}

\item{common.clusters}{A list of clusters. Ideally the ones found by MakeClusterList in common_clusters}
}
\value{
A list containing the following data structures at the given index: \cr
\strong{1} The PTM CoCluster Correlation Network as an edgelist  \cr
\strong{2} The Gene CoCluster Correlation Network as an edgelist
\strong{3} A list of nodes that are in the Gene CoCluster Correlation Network \cr
}
\description{
Make Correlation Network filters a correlation matrix of PTMs by specific PTMs.
It groups the PTM correlation matrix based on the Genes of PTMs.
By summing these submatrices, it also produces a gene by gene cocluster correlation network shows strength of relationships between proteins using the common clusters between the three distance metrics.
