\title{Extracts co-clustered PTM and gene network from a cluster filtered network object.}
\usage{
ptms_to_cfn(ptms, cfn = cfn.merged, pepsep = ";")
}
\arguments{
\item{ptms}{Character vector of PTM site strings (e.g., \"TP53 p S15\")}

\item{cfn}{List or data frame representing the cluster filtered network (default: global cfn.merged)}

\item{pepsep}{Character used to split ambiguous PTM entries (default: \";\")}
}
\value{
Subnetwork object with co-clustered PTMs and genes
}
\description{
This function takes a list of PTM (post-translational modification) site IDs and a cluster-filtered network,
extracts the genes from unambiguous and ambiguous PTM entries, then returns the co-clustered subnetwork.
}
\examples{
# Example input objects
ptms <- c(\"TP53 p S15\", \"BRCA1 p S123; BRCA1 p T124\", \"MDM2 p S200\")
# Example network (edge list with 'source', 'target', and cluster info, could be data.frame or igraph)
cfn.merged <- data.frame(source = c(\"TP53\", \"BRCA1\", \"BRCA1\", \"MDM2\"),
                         target = c(\"BRCA1\", \"MDM2\", \"TP53\", \"TP53\"),
                         cluster = c(1,1,2,1))
# Suppose filter.edges.0 and get.co.clustered.ptms are also defined and loaded
# The following returns the gene/PTM subnetwork
res <- ptms_to_cfn(ptms, cfn = cfn.merged, pepsep = \";\")
print(res)
