\usage{
GetSTRINGdb(gene.cccn)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene.cccn}{A matrix showing strength of relationships between proteins using common clusters between the three distance metrics (Euclidean, Spearman, and Combined (SED))}
}
\value{
Data frame of consisting of the network of interactions from the genes of study pulled from the STRINGdb database and a list of gene names
}
\description{
This function finds protein-protein interaction weights by consulting utilizing the STRINGdb database.
The package STRINGdb is required for this function. To download, run:
\itemize{
\item if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
\item BiocManager::install("STRINGdb")
}
}
